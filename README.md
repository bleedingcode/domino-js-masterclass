This contains the Source Code and DevOps configurations for the Domino JS Masterclass by John Jardin and Paul Withers


### Testing Apache Wink REST services
This needs further investigation. This may be an option.

Alternatively SpringMockServletInvocationTest may be a route https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15203197/unit-testing-apache-wink-rest-service-with-mockservletinvocationtest.

Alternatively, something like Mockito or JMock may be the route to go.

We still need a Mock factory to skip Domino-specific code though. What level of code coverage can we get???
